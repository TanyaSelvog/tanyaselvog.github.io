Today is the start of Domestic Violence Awareness & Prevention month. As a survivor of DV, I find it helpful to bring awareness of this issue to others.

There are so many shitty people in this world and that includes many people who enable abusers. I don't have time for shitty people in my life and I am so happy that I've done so much for myself and I have support and helpful people in my life.
