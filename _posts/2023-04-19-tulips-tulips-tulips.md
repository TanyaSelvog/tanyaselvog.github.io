I didn't think about flowers much for most of my life. I thought they were pretty, but also just something 'not for me'. I'm very happy that a few years ago I started to learn more about flowers and I occasionally purchased a bouquet of various flowers for myself. Today I went to [RoozenGaarde](https://www.tulips.com/tulip-festival-information) for their Tulips Festival and it was so beautiful.
