title: "Learning Azure: Playing w/Document Translator"
---
##### Background 
I passed my Azure AI Fundamentals exam this past week and now that I'm done studying, I have actually have time to tinker around with  Azure AI. 

A favorite hobby of mine is to research my family genealogy. I have a family tree on Ancestry.com, and have spent a lot of time on that site gathering resources. A large part of my family is from Germany. T and I'm currently struggling with translating old records into English. 

##### Defining the Problem
I'd like to figure out if there is a way that I can use Azure AI + Machine Learning to translate old, handwritten German family records.

##### Actions

My first step was to look into what services I thought would help me. Since Azure AI offers Document Translation (currently in Preview mode), I opened up the Language Studio and started there. 


##### Results
