#### Build Automation Tools üõ†Ô∏è

A build tool is a script, framework, or any kind of software created specifically for a given programming language to compile code, run tests on it, or do other operations needed for a build.

Prior to Maven and Gradle, [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/), was released in 2000, and uses XML for dependencies and the code build process. 

##### Maven

Apache Maven was initially released in 2004 and it is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven projects are configured using a [Project Object Model (POM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model). 

* Allows developers to create a file structure in a single command
* Provides dependency manager functionality & Maven Central Repository
* Extends functionality with plug-ins
* Uses XML

##### Gradle

Initially released in 2008, Gradle is a build automation tool that is open-source and runs on the JVM. It is supported by various IDEs like Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, and Eclipse. 
* Supports multiple languages including: Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, JavaScript and C/C++
* Build scripts are written in Groovy DSL (domain specific language)
* Declarative style of programming
* Allows for an incremental build
* Doesn‚Äôt have to be installed separately 
* Chosen by Google to be the official build tool for Android
