This past weekend I ran the Refuse to Abuse 5K at T-Mobile Park. It was the first time in which I ran inside of a sports stadium and the course layout was rather interesting. Parts of the course were outside at the parking garage and other parts were at the various suite-levels where it was rather warm because it was inside. It was a nice course and I plan on doing again with some friends next year where we plan on walking it, as the course seems to be better suited for walkers versus runners.
