I made a ghost dog to add to my Seattle Kraken altar with the hope that it would bring good luck. I was gifted a [Kraken calendar](https://seattlehockeyteamstore.com/products/sk-dog-calendar) and since the playoff games, I've been making LEGO dog MOCs to help bring good luck to the team. For October, Tanev is sitting next to a dog dressed as a ghost, so that was my inspiration for my 👻🐶.
