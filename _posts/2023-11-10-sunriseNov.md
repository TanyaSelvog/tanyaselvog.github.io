title:  "Sunrise November Style"

I've been sick lately and it's been pretty frustrating. Low energy, persistent cough and general malaise combined with work stress has been taking a toll on my health. I had enough energy yesterday morning that I went to the gym and weight lifted. When I got back to my apartment, I saw that the sky was a pretty yellow-orange, so I went up to the rooftop and looked at the sunrise.
