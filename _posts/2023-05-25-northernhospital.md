First trip to Northern State Area Recreation. ☺️

The park sits on land that was formerly a mental health facility in the state of Washington. I found out about the hike thanks to the [Washington Trails Association's hiking guide](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/northern-state-ghost-town) and I was interested in checking it out because of it's history and because I love seeing old buildings. Unfortunately the buildings were covered with graffiti. We hiked to the cemetery and most of the stones are missing or sinking into the ground, and even then, it's not possible to figure out who people were because the headstones only have initials on them. One of the earliest patients got a headstone which still exists and I did a little research on [Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com) and I found out that the young man died from pneumonia.
