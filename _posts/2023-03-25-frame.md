I love building practical things out of LEGO. In the past, I've made holders for my iPhone and containers for pens and markers. I've never been very successful making a photo frame that I've loved, but since I have some new photos that I wanted to display, I decided to give it a shot and I created a frame that I'm pretty happy with.

I wanted the frame to be at an angle, so I put three hinge plate 1x2 (with 7 teeth) on the bottom so the frame would be slightly tilted when upright.

I covered the edge of the frame and placed the edging in a way that it would also make the photo be set in place.

The final product being displayed. I'm really happy that while I was constructing the frame, I grabbed an older 4x6 photo to use for testing, as I wanted to make sure that it would fit and look alright.

My final design was great as a starting point and I'm happy that I completed it, as many times, I've found myself to be frustrated with my design and I've given up, but not this time. I'm going to iterate on the design in the future with one of the goals being to see if I can make better use of parts.
