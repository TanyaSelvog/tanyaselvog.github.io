I made a MOC of my recent trip to RoozenGaarde. I struggled with finding pieces to make a decent-looking windmill, so instead I focused on the texture of the windmill. I also iterated on the design as the first product looked too similar to a tombstone and a gravesite, so I rebased the bottom and added to the scene to flush it out.
